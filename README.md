# Hashketball

## Learning Goals

* Practice iterating over nested hashes.

## Instructions

Welcome to the second part of Hashketball. In this lab, you will be implementing
methods to work with a nested data structure. You've already built the structure
in the previous lab, so we've provided it for you in this lab.

To recap - your task is to use Ruby to help you perform analysis on an NBA game.
Process the nested data structure to produce _insights_ about how various
players performed.

We also strongly recommend that you read the ***entire*** README before you
start coding. We're going to show some tips and tricks that make the coding a
lot easier...but only if you read through to the end.

Code your solution in `hashketball.rb` following the steps below. The solution
from the previous lab is implemented in `game_hash`. Note that the tests are
still present, so the first tests will already be passing. Keep `game_hash` as
is, using the other methods to access information.

## Building Methods

We have a nested data structure. Now we need to process it to produce
_insights_. Since you have a thorough understanding of the nested data structure
(you wrote it, after all), we don't need to review things like using `pp` to
"pretty-print" the nested data structure. We can pick up on our process from
where we need to start processing the nested data structure into _insights_.

1. Ensure you can read data out of the nested data structure with simple, basic
   `[]` calls.

    You can confirm this by starting IRB from this lesson's main directory and
    requiring the `hashketball.rb` file with `require './hashketball.rb'`

    ```sh
    2.6.1 :001 > require './hashketball.rb'
     => true
    ```

    Once required, you can interact with the `game_hash` method. Calling
    `game_hash[:home][:team_name]`, for example, should return
    `"Brooklyn Nets"`. This is because `game_hash` returns a hash - we can chain
    `[]` calls the hash it returns.

2. Wrap basic code that "reaches into" the nested data structure in methods
   that have friendly human-names. Wrap basic (or "First Order") methods into
   methods that do more ("Nth Order") and are human-brain-friendly (`list_snacks`)
3. Be flexible; work from what you have to where you want to go; or, work
   backward; or, make a midpoint between what you have and what you need to
   have

While you might have seen this pattern with simple nested data structure work,
this pattern **is still valid**. The only thing that's changed is that in some
places you can see where an Enumerable could make your code clearer and
briefer.  ***This process works***. Take this lab as a chance to hone your
skills attacking BIG problems with process _on your side_.

### Applying Nested Data Structure-Processing Process

Run `learn`. There are a whole bunch of methods that are expected to exist. The
first one is `num_points_scored`. But there's so much output. Let's make it
more manageable.

We can run this method's test, again by using the [-e][example] or `--example`
flag: `rspec spec/hashketball_spec.rb -e num_points_scored`.

> **PRO TIP**: You can use this strategy to run small chunks of the test suite.
> Simply look in the `spec/hashketball_spec.rb` file and find a `describe`
> block. You can run all the tests under it by using that block's `String` as
> an argument to `-e`.

That `num_points_scored` method produces an _insight_. Here's a specification:

* Build a method, `num_points_scored` that takes in an argument of a player's
  name and returns the number of points scored for that player.

Why don't we define that method and have it return `game_hash`?

```ruby
def num_points_scored
  game_hash
end
```

Run the test again. Sure enough, our method fails (unsurprisingly), but the test
results have changed. Continue to add code to get `num_points_scored` working.
If you need to "invent" helper methods, to help you process `game_hash`, do so!
Here's some sample thought process:

> Think about where in the hash you will find a player's `:points`. How can you
> iterate down into that level? Think about the return value of your method.
> Remember that `.each` returns the original collection that you are iterating
> over. How can you return the number of points for a particular player? How
> would we have done it with a simple `while` loop? Which Enumerable helps
> here? Is a while-loop better than an Enumerable? _Etc._

If you repeat the process we just explored together, you will be able to
deliver more complex methods to satisfy tests. Find a failing test, build a
"skeleton method," iterate on the code, get success, and move on. This is the
way software is "grown" in the real world.

### Additional Methods

* Build a method, `shoe_size`, that takes in an argument of a player's name and
  returns the shoe size for that player.

  * Think about how you will find the shoe size of the correct player. How can
    you check and see if a player's name matches the name that has been passed
    into the method as an argument?

* Build a method, `team_colors`, that takes in an argument of the team name and
  returns an `Array` of that team's colors.

* Build a method, `team_names`, that operates on the game `Hash` to return an
  `Array` of the team names.

* Build a method, `player_numbers`, that takes in an argument of a team name and
  returns an `Array` of the jersey numbers for that team.

* Build a method, `player_stats`, that takes in an argument of a player's name
  and returns a hash of that player's stats.

  * Check out the following example of the expected return value of the
    `player_stats` method:

  ```bash
  player_stats("Alan Anderson")
  => {
        :player_name => "Alan Anderson",
        :number => 0,
        :shoe => 16,
        :points => 22,
        :rebounds => 12,
        :assists => 12,
        :steals => 3,
        :blocks => 1,
        :slam_dunks => 1
      }
  ```

* Build a method, `big_shoe_rebounds`, that will return the number of rebounds
  associated with the player that has the largest shoe size. Break this one down
  into steps:

  * First, find the player with the largest shoe size
  * Then, return that player's number of rebounds
  * Remember to think about return values here.

**Bonus Questions:**

If you would like to take on a few more challenges, there are a few more things
you can do. There are not tests for this content - these are provide for
additional practice working with hash data.

Define methods to return the answer to the following questions:

1. Which player has the most points? Call the method `most_points_scored`.

2. Which team has the most points? Call the method `winning_team`.

3. Which player has the longest name? Call the method `player_with_longest_name`.

**Super Bonus:**

1. Write a method that returns true if the player with the longest name had the
   most steals. Call the method `long_name_steals_a_ton?`.

## "I am completely stuck"

This is a challenging lab. Process, small methods, helper methods. All of
these are tools that are designed to get you un-stuck.

One last tool is the "Pry" debugging library - it can be a real help.

From the command line run the command `gem install pry` if you haven't installed
it already. If the `gem` command returns telling you that pry was installed or
that it's already installed, the following should work for you.

Next, at the top of `hashketball.rb` put the line `require "pry"`.

Using Pry, when running RSpec tests with the `learn` command, we can pause the
execution of our Ruby code. This allows us to step into the code and play with
any available variables or methods that are in scope.

We tell Ruby where to pause by writing `binding.pry` in our code. When Ruby
sees that magic word, it will stop execution and hand things over to a REPL
called Pry. It's there that we can do the inspection.

Below is an example start for `num_points_scored` with `binding.pry` included:

```ruby
def num_points_scored(player_name)
  binding.pry
  game_hash.each do |location, team_data|
    #are you ABSOLUTELY SURE what 'location' and 'team data' are? use binding.pry to find out!
    binding.pry
    team_data.each do |attribute, data|
      #are you ABSOLUTELY SURE what 'attribute' and 'team data' are? use binding.pry to find out!
      binding.pry

      #what is 'data' at each loop throughout .each block? when will the following line of code work and when will it break?
      data.each do |data_item|
          binding.pry
      end
    end
  end
end
```

At every place Ruby sees `binding.pry`, it will stop the program's execution.
While the program is stopped, you can print out variables that are in scope. At
the first `binding.pry` in the example above, you can type in `player_name` and
have the value printed out by Pry. At the second `binding.pry`, you will be able
to access `player_name`, `location`, and `team_data` and have those values
printed out by `pry`. When you're done at one binding, type `exit` and the code
will resume running (until it hits another `binding.pry`). If you're all done
with a given `pry` session `exit-program` or `exit!` will close Pry and return
you to the command-line.

When running `learn`, if any `binding.pry` lines are present in the solution,
Pry will still kick in so you may want to remove them once you think you've
solved a method.


## Conclusion

This is a new frontier for you! You are now using powerful tools of Ruby
to transform a nested data structure that you made from non-computer-ready
data to produce insights. You've made huge strides in becoming a really solid
developer in the procedural programming paradigm. This is a huge moment.
Celebrate it!

Believe it or not, the code that put rockets in space and mankind on the Moon
were only slight variations on this style of programming. You've learned
something really powerful!
